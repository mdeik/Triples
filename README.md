# Triples
This coding project is an implementation of the game logic for a game similar to the app Threes on the Apple and Android app stores. The project requires the implementation of the "collapse" action, which is used when the player swipes in a direction to collapse each row or column parallel to the swipe. This action involves eliminating blank tiles, combining 1 and 2 tiles, or combining two consecutive tiles with the same value, 3 or higher. The project also includes defining a class Triples in the model.swift file, which implements several methods for initializing, rotating, shifting, and collapsing the board. There are also two external functions to be built: one for rotating a 2D Int array clockwise and another generic function that can rotate any type of array.

This project reveals an understanding of game logic implementation and programming skills in Swift. It shows experience in building functions that modify 2D arrays and building classes that can implement various game mechanics such as rotation, shifting, and collapsing. Furthermore, the implementation of the two external functions shows an understanding of generics and the ability to build generic functions in Swift. This project is a great example of skills and experience in game development and Swift programming.
